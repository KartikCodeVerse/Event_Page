                  For Aliet Sarah, fashion month was about more than clothes.

                  Africa is the future and models of color are being appreciated

                  Like many students, rising Somali star Ugbad Abdi took a gap
                  year after high school to fulfill her personal goals. But
                  rather than backpacking across Europe, Abdi decided to give
                  modeling a try and quickly became one of the season’s
                  standouts walking Miu Miu, Valentino, Off-White, and opening
                  Marc Jacobs. “I started my Fashion Week by feeling really
                  fearful because I didn’t know what to expect,” she said. “It
                  has been a roller coaster of surprises.”
